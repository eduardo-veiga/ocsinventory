                                            If no "path to folder" provided, agent assume folder as data folder

/debug[=level]                              Generate a very verbose log file "ocsinventory.log" into agent's install folder
                                            0 => disable verbose logs (default)
                                            1 => enable default verbose logs (default when no level provided provided)

/notag		                                Agent must NOT prompt user for TAG in any case

/tag="my value"                             Agent must set "my value" as TAG value

/xml=["path to folder"]                     Agent must store inventory in uncompressed xml format into folder "path to folder"

/force		                                Always send inventory, even if server does not ask for it (use only for debugging purpose !)

/ipdisc="network number"	                Agent must launch IP discovery on network "network number" (use only for debugging purpose !)

/ipdisc_lat="number of milliseconds"        Set latency between 2 IP Discover requests to "number of milliseconds"

/fastip		                                Never wait for latency between 2 IP Discover requests (use only for debugging purpose !)

/hkcu                                       Search also for software under HKEY_CURRENT_USER registry hive (do not work with service as LocalSystem !)

                                            Agent try to connect to Communication Server address and port Listening on http[s]://server.domain.tld[:port]/ocsinventory

/ssl=0|1                                    When using SSL connections, 0 => SSL without certificate validation, 1 => SSL with server certificate validation required (needs CA certificate)

/ca="path_to_cabundle.pem"                  Path to CA certificate chain file in PEM format, for server certificate validation

/user=username                              Communication Server authentication credentials
/pwd=password

/proxy_type=0|1|2|3                         Agent proxy use (0 => no, 1 => HTTP proxy, 2 => Socks 4 proxy, 3 => Socks 5 proxy)

/proxy=proxy_address                        Proxy server address (without protocol !)

Configuration file:
-------------------

Some command line options can be stored in the configuration file. Default is assumed to be ocsinventory.ini in the agent's data folder, usually "%ALLUSERSPROFILE%\Application Data\OCS Inventory NG\Agent".
Agent can create this configuration using /save_conf command line switch, to allow encrypting into config file username and password.

Here is a sample configuration file to talk with a server on local computer.
